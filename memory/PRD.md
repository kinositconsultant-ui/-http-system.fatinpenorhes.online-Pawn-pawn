# PRD — Fatin Penhores Pawn System

**Last updated:** 2026-02 (Iteration 33 — Month-end Compliance Bundle)

## Original Problem Statement
Pawn shop management system for Fatin Penhores (Dili, Timor-Leste). Modules: Dashboard, Client Management, Pawn Item Management (separate tables for Car, Motorcycle, Electronic), Pawn Contract Module (CTR-YYYY-#### numbering, 10/15% interest, statuses), Payment Module (full/partial/interest-only), Auction Module, Reports, PDF/Print, User Account/Admin Module, Public Website.

Flow: Client → Pawn Item → Contract → Payment → Redeem / Reactivate / Auction → Invoice → Report.

## User Personas
- **Admin** — full access including users, settings, audit log, deletions.
- **Staff** — clients, items, contracts, payments, auctions (no user mgmt, no settings).
- **Cashier** — payments only; read access to clients/contracts/items.
- **Public visitor** — public site, contact form, auction listings.

## Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI + MongoDB (motor). JWT in httpOnly cookies. PDFs via ReportLab. Object storage via Emergent integrations. WhatsApp Cloud API (Meta).
- **Frontend**: React 19 + react-router v7 + Shadcn/UI + Tailwind + Recharts. Bilingual EN/TET.

## Implemented (Iter 1 + Iter 2 + Iter 3)
### Core (Iter 1)
- JWT auth, admin seed, role-based access.
- Clients CRUD with TL address taxonomy.
- Three separate item collections (cars / motorcycles / electronics).
- Contracts with CTR-YYYY-#### auto-number, status recomputation.
- Payments with RCP-YYYY-#### receipts.
- Auction lifecycle. Reports + CSV export. PDFs.
- Public site (Home, Auction, Warehouse, About, Contact).

### Operations (Iter 2)
- Settings page with bilingual T&C templates, WhatsApp credentials, reminder window.
- Default interest by item type (Car 10 / Motorcycle 15 / Electronic 15) with manual override.
- Richer contract PDF.
- Object storage uploads for photos + documents.
- Recharts dashboard (monthly trends + overdue by type).
- **Cashier role** (payments-only RBAC).
- Audit log on key mutations.
- WhatsApp Cloud API (Meta direct) — mocked when token absent.
- Language toggle EN ↔ TET.

### Compliance & Business Logic (Iter 3 — 2026-02)
- **Client picture upload** (storage_path) + "View Details" action with bilingual modal showing photo, profile, contracts, payment history.
- **Drivers License** added to id_type (BI / Electoral / Passport / Drivers License).
- **Multi-pawn per client** — backend already supports any number of concurrent contracts per client.
- Item fields: **market_value** added; **manufacture_year** (renamed from year) on all 3 item types.
- **Contract max term 62 days** (~2 months) enforced on create AND on reactivate.
- **Reactivate overdue contracts** — new POST /api/contracts/{id}/reactivate; clears penalty; status → active; new due date in future, capped 62 days from today.
- **Principal vs Interest split** in payment math: partial payments reduce principal first; interest_only payments reduce interest first; full pays interest then principal. Minimum 1 interest period always charged.
- **10% Penalty** of original loan amount auto-applied when contract is overdue (excludes interest); shown in dedicated Contracts table column.
- **Client payment history** endpoint GET /api/clients/{id}/payments aggregated across every contract.
- **Tetum contract PDF** matching the official template with 14 articles, header band, summary box, item detail table, signature block.

## Implemented (Iter 8 — 2026-02)
- **Finance/Invoices PDF exports** (per user request "add pdf in finance module in each category"):
  - `GET /api/finance/summary/export/pdf` — branded Finance Summary PDF (KPIs + cash flow + expenses by category).
  - `GET /api/finance/capital-sources/export/pdf` — Capital Sources register with totals (principal/repaid/outstanding).
  - `GET /api/finance/expenses/export/pdf?category=&month=&year=` — Operating Expenses PDF with optional per-category filter (Salary/Maintenance/Utilities/etc.) and date filters; includes a by-category summary when no filter is set.
  - `GET /api/invoices/export/pdf` — Invoice Register (all invoices).
  - `GET /api/invoices/{id}/pdf` — Single Invoice PDF (auto-generated when an auction is marked sold).
- **Auctions sold flow now idempotent** — re-posting `/auctions/{aid}/sold` returns the existing invoice rather than minting duplicates.
- **Frontend**: "Summary PDF" button in Finance header, "Export PDF" buttons on Capital Sources & Expenses tabs, category-filter dropdown in Expenses tab, new "Invoices" tab listing all invoices with per-row PDF buttons + bulk export. Auctions page shows an invoice download link on sold rows.
- **EN/TET i18n** keys added for invoice/finance terms.

## Implemented (Iter 9 — 2026-02)
- **Pezadu (Heavy Equipment) category** — backend `pezadus` collection + frontend tab with subcategories Forklift / Tractor / Loader / Heavy Duty Truck. Default interest rate configurable in Settings.
- **WhatsApp Meta API — real integration** with **Fernet encryption** (`/app/backend/encryption.py`) for token at rest. Settings UI shows masked token preview + connected badge. `POST /api/whatsapp/test` validates creds against Meta Graph API.
- **Public Warehouse password gate** — admin sets `warehouse_password` in Settings; visitors must unlock via `POST /api/public/warehouse-unlock` to view `/public/warehouse`. Status endpoint reports locked/unlocked.
- **Automated daily backups** — `apscheduler` background job at 02:00 UTC, keeps last 7 snapshots in `/app/backups`. Settings UI lists existing backups, lets admin manually trigger `/admin/backups/generate` and `/admin/backups/generate-project` (full source-code zip), and download with path-traversal protection.
- **Public website redesign** — navy header + yellow active links + Services, Simulasaun, FAQ pages.
- **UI polish** — color-coded Item tabs (Cars/Motos/Electronics/Pezadu), compact non-wrapping tables across Contracts/Clients/Payments/Auctions, shortened CT-2026-N contract display, universal red PDF download buttons.
- **Bugfix**: backups subprocess now uses `sys.executable` (was bare `python3` → resolved to system python without `motor` → 500). Verified zips generate and download correctly.

## Implemented (Iter 10 — 2026-02)
- **Item name + machine_number** — Car / Motorcycle / Pezadu all gained `name` (e.g., "Toyota Hilux 2026 Black") and `machine_number` (engine no., distinct from chassis). Visible in forms + tables.
- **Pre-Auction workflow** — Contracts 1-10 days overdue are tolerated and listed in a Pre-Auction amber card. Contracts > 10 days overdue auto-transition to `auction_ready` status. New computed fields on every contract response: `days_overdue` (int), `penalty_paid`, `penalty_full`.
- **Overdue Payments** — New Payments tab + dedicated dialog with 3 modes:
  - `overdue_full` → covers Penalty → Interest → Principal (full close-out; status → `redeemed`)
  - `overdue_interest_pen` → covers Penalty → Interest (principal stays open)
  - `overdue_penalty_only` → records only the 10% penalty payment (so the cash is captured in the books)
- **Client Payment Summary** — Inside Client View Details modal, a 5-card grid (Total Paid / Full / Partial / Interest / Penalty) totals across ALL contracts.
- **Finance — Capital Sources rate/term selectors** — Rate dropdown 2-10%, Term dropdown 6-12 months, live interest preview (`principal × rate × term-factor`).
- **Finance — Loan Calculator tab** — Standalone simulator with rate (2-10%), term (6-12), monthly/yearly period. Live total interest, total repayment, monthly payment, 12-month schedule.
- **Auction Sold split** — `AuctionSoldIn.interest_fee` optional. When provided, `cash_portion = sold_price − interest_fee`. When omitted, auto-computed from contract's outstanding interest + penalty. `interest_fee` flows to `net_profit` in `/finance/summary`; `sold_price + tax` flows to `cash_on_hand`. **Buyer invoice PDF intentionally shows only Subtotal/Tax/Total — no interest line.** Internal accounting stored as `_internal_interest_fee` / `_internal_cash_portion` on the invoice doc.
- **Bugfix (testing agent)**: `PezaduIn` model was missing `name` + `machine_number` (Pydantic v2 'ignore' silently dropped them on POST). Added both with empty defaults.

## Implemented (Iter 13 — 2026-02)
- **Per-user Module Access (RBAC v2)** — admin can now tick which modules each user can access when creating/editing them.
  - Backend: `UserOut` / `auth/me` / `auth/login` all expose `allowed_modules: List[str]`. New constants `ALL_MODULES` (11 modules) + `ROLE_DEFAULT_MODULES` ({admin: all, staff: 7, cashier: dashboard+payments}). New `require_module(name)` dependency factory; applied to list endpoints for clients, items, contracts, payments, auctions, dashboard, finance, reports/v2. Admin role always bypasses (returns immediately). New GET `/api/users/modules` catalog endpoint (admin-only). PATCH `/api/users/{id}` supports `allowed_modules`. POST creating an admin auto-locks to `ALL_MODULES`. Bad module names are silently filtered out.
  - **Migration**: on boot, every existing user document without `allowed_modules` is backfilled with the role default (admin → all 11, staff → 7, cashier → [dashboard, payments]).
  - Frontend Users page (full rewrite): Module Access checkbox grid (11 items, 3 columns) + 4 preset buttons (Staff preset / Cashier preset / All / None). Role dropdown — selecting admin auto-locks all 11 checkboxes and disables them + the preset buttons. Edit dialog (PATCH) pre-fills email (disabled), name, role, current modules. Users list table now shows a Modules column with badge pills per user (admins show "All modules").
  - Frontend Sidebar (`AdminLayout`): nav items are filtered by `user.allowed_modules`. A cashier with only `[dashboard, payments]` sees only those 2 nav links. Admin always sees all 11.

## Implemented (Iter 14 — 2026-02) — P2 polish batch
- **Color-coded Reports tabs** — each of the 7 tabs has a distinct accent color when active (navy / green / terracotta / amber / violet / teal / sage) plus a tinted background when inactive.
- **Shortened document numbers everywhere** — `RCP-2026-0042 → RC-2026-42`, `INV-2026-0015 → INV-2026-15`, `CTR-2026-0112 → CT-2026-112`. Helper: `/app/frontend/src/lib/docNumbers.js`. Full number preserved in `title` attr for hover. Applied across Payments, Clients (payment history modal), Finance Invoices tab, Auctions invoice badge.
- **Photo thumbnails in Items table** — new leftmost "Photo" column (40×40). Renders clickable thumbnail that opens full image in new tab, or dashed placeholder square when no `photo_url`.
- **Public Auction page with password gate** (`/auction`) — locked orange card requires the visitor password. **Shares the existing `warehouse_password`** so one visitor pass unlocks both `/warehouse` and `/auction` (token via `sessionStorage['fp_warehouse_token']`). Backend `/api/public/auction-items` enforces 401 without `unlock_token` when password is set. New `/api/public/auction-status` endpoint. Frontend: colored category chips (navy/terracotta/green/amber), filter row, "Lock" re-lock button.
- **Client-side route guard** — new `ModuleGuard` wraps every admin route. When a non-admin user navigates to a forbidden module they see (a) a red 403 "Access denied" panel with module name + Back to Dashboard button, (b) a sonner toast.error, (c) auto-redirect to `/dashboard` after 2.5s. Admins always bypass.
- **Pezadu filter in Reports → Inventory** — verified pre-existing.

## Implemented (Iter 16 — 2026-02)
- **Loan Disbursement auto-record** — creating a contract now inserts a `Payment` with `type="disbursement"`, `amount=loan_amount`, `date=contract_date`, `notes="Loan disbursed to client at contract signing"`. Appears in client payment history + Finance client_payments filter excludes it (loans_disbursed already reflects the cash-out, prevents double count). `_recompute_contract_status` skips `type="disbursement"` so paid_amount stays 0.
- **"Loan Disbursement Receipt" PDF** — same `/api/payments/{pid}/pdf` endpoint auto-adapts when `payment.type=="disbursement"`: title becomes "Resibu Entrega Empréstimu · Loan Disbursement Receipt"; box switches from repayment layout (Principal/Interest Remaining, Penalty) to disbursement layout (Loan Amount, Amount Received by Client, Interest Rate at maturity, Contract Start/Due). Client signs this on receiving the loan.
- **Frontend Payments — 3rd tab "Disbursements"** — blue-tinted table showing only disbursement transactions with a blue badge (`bg-blue-100 text-blue-900 border-blue-300`). Regular Payments tab now excludes disbursements.
- **Contract PDF — 2 new clauses in Artigu 4º (Prazu Kontratu)**:
  - "Kontratu liu loron 1 konsidera fulan 1" — contract past day 1 counts as 1 full month of interest.
  - "Tolerasia 10 dias — wainhira liu loron 10, kompania sei halo leilaun ka faan sasán penhor (kareta, motor, pezadu)." — 10-day tolerance then auction.

## Implemented (Iter 17 — 2026-02)
- **Backend refactor phase 1**: extracted shared code to `/app/backend/deps.py` (~150 lines): DB client, ALL_MODULES, ROLE_DEFAULT_MODULES, COLLECTION_MAP, `get_current_user`, `require_admin`, `require_module`, `require_roles`, `require_not_cashier`, `write_audit`, `utcnow_iso`, `new_id`, logger. `server.py` now imports from `deps` and shrunk from 2633 → ~2570 lines. All API paths and behavior unchanged.
- **Daily WhatsApp overdue reminders** — new `/app/backend/reminders.py` runs at **00:00 UTC = 09:00 Timor (UTC+9)** via APScheduler CronTrigger. Targets contracts overdue by exactly 7 or 9 days. Sends EN/TET WhatsApp messages via existing `wapp.send_text`. Duplicate prevention via `db.reminder_log` (contract_id + day_bucket + date). UTC-safe date math (`datetime.now(timezone.utc).date()`) so scheduler-timezone drift can't cause double-sends.
- New backend endpoints: `GET /api/reminders/status`, `POST /api/reminders/run` (manual trigger), `GET /api/reminders/logs` (last 90 days, capped at 500 rows) — all admin-only.
- `SettingsIn.reminders_enabled` master toggle (default `True`). When off, run returns `{disabled: True, scanned: 0}`.
- **Settings UI**: new `RemindersCard` between WhatsApp Config and Backups — Bell icon + title + schedule, "Run now" outline button, on/off toggle (accent-amber), 4 stat tiles (Last run / Next run / Sent / Skipped-Errors), dedup explanation footer.

## Implemented (Iter 18 — 2026-02)
- **Payment receipt PDF now includes the Pawn Item block** — Type, Category, Name/Model, Brand, Year, Color, Machine No., Chassis, Plate, Market Value, and optional free-text Description. Warm cream background (#F5F1EA) to visually differentiate from the money box. Applies to BOTH disbursement AND regular repayment receipts.
- **Signature line auto-prints the client's full_name** in bold navy on the left, "Fatin Penhores" on the right, with "Client Signature" / "Authorized Officer" labels below. Client signs next to their own printed name (mirrors passport / notary form UX).
- **Orphan-safe**: if the pawn item was deleted, the receipt still renders cleanly and simply omits the Pawn Item block. Explicit truthiness check (`item and (item.brand or item.name or item.model)`) prevents empty placeholders.

## Implemented (Iter 19 — 2026-02)
- **Pre-Auction Actions Column** — new rightmost column on the amber Pre-Auction card in `/contracts`. 4 icon buttons per row for instant action:
  - **WhatsApp** (emerald, `pa-whatsapp-{id}`) — sends Tetum reminder via existing `/api/whatsapp/send`.
  - **Reactivate** (blue, `pa-reactivate-{id}`) — opens the existing dialog to extend the due date.
  - **Move to Auction** (terracotta, `pa-auction-{id}`) — appears **only** on `auction_ready` rows (>10 days overdue); confirms then calls `/api/auctions/move`.
  - **Download PDF** (red, `pa-pdf-{id}`) — opens contract PDF in a new tab.
- Reuses existing helpers (`sendWhatsApp`, `openReactivate`, `moveToAuction`) — zero backend changes.
- Layout verified at 1600×900 EN + 1366×768 EN/TET — no overflow, actions reachable.

## Implemented (Iter 20 — 2026-02) — BREAKING interest model change
- **Monthly interest calculation (Article 4)** — replaces the previous flat one-time rate. Rules:
  - `per_month_interest = loan × rate% / 100`
  - `months_elapsed = max(1, ceil((max(due_date, today) - contract_date) / 30))` — "1 day past = counts as month 1"
  - `interest_amount = per_month_interest × months_elapsed`
  - Overdue contracts have interest that automatically ticks up as time passes
  - New contract response fields: `months_elapsed`, `per_month_interest`, `next_interest_date`
- **"Next Payment" block on receipt PDF** (bilingual Tetum + English) — appears on repayment receipts (not disbursement, not fully-paid):
  - Next payment date
  - Current balance
  - Next month interest (+$X)
  - If unpaid by that date, new total = current + next month
  - Advisory paragraph: "Favor selu iha loron X atu evita interese fulan tan · Please pay by X to avoid another month of interest"
- Repayment box also shows `Interest Rate (per month)` label + `Months Billed So Far` row.
- **Backwards impact**: existing overdue contracts now show higher interest (e.g., 111-day overdue contract that used to show $50 flat now shows $180 for 6 months × $30/mo). Confirmed by user before deployment.

## Test Coverage (cumulative)
- Iter20: **31/31 PASS** — 15 new (Article 4 math on 115 contracts, next_interest_date always strictly future + 30-day aligned, PDF block appears/omits per spec) + 16 iter16+18 regression.
- Iter19 (Pre-Auction actions): 20/20 frontend PASS.
- Iter18 (Pawn Item + auto sign name): 9/9 PASS.
- Iter17 (refactor + reminders): 27/27 PASS.
- Iter14-16: covered.

## Test Coverage (Iter 14)
- Backend: **290/290 PASS** (244 prior + 7 new iter14 auction-gate + 24 iter13 regression + 15 iter10 regression rerun).
- Frontend Playwright iter14: **14/14 PASS** (all bullets in the spec: reports colors, RC/CT/INV short numbers + hover full, photo column, pezadu filter, auction gate + unlock + colored grid + filters + lock-again, sessionStorage sharing, ModuleGuard on 9 forbidden routes for cashier + admin bypass on all routes).

## Test Coverage (Iter 10-13)
- Iter13 (module access RBAC v2): 24+15 PASS.
- Iter12 (items table layout): 15+6 PASS.
- Iter10 (6 new features): 15 PASS.
- Frontend spot-check: login → dashboard → items (4 tabs incl. Heavy Equipment) → contracts (CT-2026 short numbers + red PDF buttons) → settings (WhatsApp + Backups + Warehouse password) → finance (KPIs + charts + 3 tabs) → public Warehouse password gate.

## Test Coverage (Iter 8)
- Backend: **141/141 PASS** (118 prior + 23 new iter8 finance/invoice PDF tests).

## Implemented (Iter 6 — 2026-02)
- **Finance / Treasury module** — admin-only page at `/finance`.
  - **Capital Sources** CRUD (Bank / Company / Personal / Partner / Other) with principal, interest rate, period, start/due date, plus **Repayments** to reduce outstanding balance.
  - **Operating Expenses** CRUD with categories Salary / Maintenance / Travel / Meals / Compensation / Utilities / Rent / Other; cashiers blocked from creating expenses.
  - **Finance Summary** KPIs: cash_on_hand, capital_received/repaid/outstanding, loans_disbursed, client_payments, auction_sales, expenses_total + period, gross_profit, net_profit + expenses_by_category breakdown.
  - **Cash flow BarChart** (inflows green / outflows terracotta) + **Expenses Pie chart** by category.
- **Treasury report** as 7th tab on Reports with Excel + PDF export.
- **WhatsApp number** updated everywhere to `WhatsApp: +670 78372678` (PDF header & footer, Login hero, AdminLayout sidebar, Public footer, Public Contact, Public About).

## Test Coverage (cumulative)
- Backend: **118/118 PASS** (iter1 33 + iter2 22 + iter4-old 22 + iter5 15 + iter6 6 + iter7 20).

## Implemented (Iter 5 — 2026-02)
- **Branded rebrand** from forest green to **company navy** `#1B2D5C / #0F1B3A` (from logo).
- **FP logo image** embedded in: Contract PDF, Receipt PDF, Report PDF (top header), AdminLayout sidebar, PublicLayout header & footer, Login hero.
- **PDF header & footer** show full company details: `FATIN PENHORES UNIPESSOAL, LDA · Caicoli, Dili, Timor-Leste · Tel: 78372678 · fatinpenhores@gmail.com` + copyright `© 2026 Fatin Penhores. All Rights Reserved.` plus a navy left-edge accent bar and silver inner bar matching the logo.
- **Reports**: PDF export button = **red**, Excel button = **green**.
- Public site Contact / About / footer updated with new address, tel, and email.
- Logo bytes are cached in memory after first read to avoid per-request disk IO.

## Test Coverage (cumulative)
- Backend: **98/98 PASS** (iter1 33 + iter2 22 + iter4-old 22 + iter5 15 + iter6 6).
- **Reports module overhauled** to match user mockup: 6 tabs (Active Contracts, Payments, Overdue, Auction, Inventory, Financial), each with 2–4 KPI cards + detail table.
- **Filter bar** (Month / Year / Category / Sub-category) with Filter, Reset, Print, PDF, Excel buttons.
- **Excel export** via openpyxl with branded sheet (KPI block + table). **PDF export** via ReportLab landscape A4.
- **Item `location` field** added to Car / Motorcycle / Electronic (e.g., "Warehouse A / Shop / Off-site"). Listed in Inventory report.
- Inventory KPIs: total_items, total_amount, active_items, overdue_items, by_type{car, motorcycle, electronic}.
- Financial KPIs: total_loan, total_payment, interest_received, total_penalty, profit (= interest_received + total_penalty).

## Test Coverage (cumulative)
- Backend: **92/92 PASS** (iter1 33 + iter2 22 + iter4-old 22 + iter5 15).
- Frontend: 100% — all 6 report tabs, filters, KPI cards (20 across tabs), export links, and item-car-location field verified.

## Iteration 21 (2026-02) — Expense Categories Expansion
- Added 13 new expense categories to Finance → Tabela Despeza:
  `EDTL token Office`, `EDTL token Armazen`, `Mina Trasporte`,
  `Hadia Trasporte Lelaun No Elektróniku`, `Internet Starlink & Telemor`,
  `Pulsa telefone`, `Fo Bónus`, `Broker Trata Dokumentus`, `Gastus Jerál`,
  `Hola Materiál - Armazen 2`, `Trasporte - Armazen 2`,
  `Selu Badain - Armazen 2`, `Tabela ATK FP - Armazen 2`.
- Backend: `EXPENSE_CATEGORY_GROUPS` (ordered, grouped) replaces flat `EXPENSE_CATEGORIES` list. `GET /api/expense-categories` now returns `{groups: [{label, items[]}], flat: [...]}` for backward compatibility.
- Frontend: `Finance.js` now renders the Category `<Select>` with Shadcn `SelectGroup`/`SelectLabel` section headers (Payroll & Bonus / Utilities & Office / Armazen (Warehouse) / Transport & Fuel / Operations / Other). Applies to both the New/Edit dialog and the filter dropdown. Verified via curl + screenshot.
- Regression: `tests/test_iter7_finance.py::TestExpenseCategories::test_list_categories` updated to assert new response shape + all 13 new items present.


## Iteration 22 (2026-02) — Member ID Cards
- Complete card lifecycle for clients: **issue → PDF → renew → revoke → verify**.
- Card format: printable A4 with **front (navy)** + **back (QR)** layout, credit-card size (CR80 85.6×54mm) — cut along dashed border.
- Front: FP logo, "FATIN PENHORES / UNIPESSOAL, LDA" wordmark, "MEMBER ID CARD / Kartaun Membru" ribbon, full name (uppercased), member no., issued/expires dates, photo (from Object Storage) or initials avatar, "Pawn with confidence. Recover with dignity." tagline.
- Back: **QR code** encoding `<PUBLIC_BASE_URL>/verify/<token>`, "SCAN TO VERIFY / Skan atu verifika" (EN/TET), address, WhatsApp/email, fine print + member no.
- Backend endpoints (all `require_not_cashier`, revoke is `require_admin`):
  - `POST /api/clients/{id}/issue-card` — assigns `member_no` (`FP-YYYY-####` yearly seq), status=active, 1-year expiry, secure `member_verify_token` (idempotent — re-issue returns existing values).
  - `POST /api/clients/{id}/renew-card` — extends expiry by 365 days & flips status to active.
  - `POST /api/clients/{id}/revoke-card` (admin-only) — status=revoked.
  - `GET /api/clients/{id}/card-pdf` — returns the printable card PDF.
  - `GET /api/public/verify/{token}` — **PUBLIC (no auth)** — returns `{valid, status, member_no, full_name, photo_url, issued_at, expires_at}` for QR scans.
- Client model gains dynamic fields: `member_no`, `member_status` (`active`/`revoked`), `member_issued_at`, `member_expires_at`, `member_verify_token`.
- Frontend: Member ID Card panel added inside Client details modal (Clients.js) — badge shows Active/Expired/Revoked with color coding, buttons: **PDF**, **Verify Link** (copy to clipboard), **Renew 1 yr**, **Revoke** (admin only, hidden when already revoked).
- New public route: `/verify/:token` (VerifyMember.js) — mobile-friendly card, big status badge (green ✅ / amber ⏰ / red 🚫 / stone ❌), member photo + name + dates. No sensitive data (no ID number, address, contract details).
- New deps: `qrcode==8.2` (Pillow already installed). New env: `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` in `/app/backend/.env` — the domain used in QR codes.
- Audit log: every `issue_card` / `renew_card` / `revoke_card` recorded.
- Tests: `tests/test_iter21_member_cards.py` (10 tests: lifecycle, idempotence, PDF byte-check, public verify happy/bad-token, revoke, renew, RBAC cashier-blocked). **All 10 PASS**.


## Iteration 23 (2026-02) — Mobile Responsive Pass
- **AdminLayout** rewritten with a **slide-out drawer** for `< md` (768px). Desktop unchanged (`hidden md:flex` on the fixed sidebar). New mobile top bar (navy, 56px) shows a hamburger + FP logo + the current page label. Drawer supports body-scroll-lock while open, auto-closes on route change, has an X close button and a tap-outside backdrop. Content area gets `pt-14 md:pt-0` to account for the mobile top bar.
- **Content padding**: All admin pages now use `px-4 py-4 md:px-8 md:py-8` (was `px-8 py-8`) — much more room on phones.
- **Page headers**: Every h1 changed from `text-4xl` to `text-2xl sm:text-3xl md:text-4xl` (Dashboard, Clients, Payments, Reports, Contracts, Items, Auctions, Finance, Users, Settings, Audit Log).
- **Dashboard**: KPI grid now `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3` (was forcing 3-col at md, tight at ~800px). Cards use `p-4 md:p-6`, big numbers `text-2xl md:text-3xl` with `break-words`. Charts `h-64 md:h-72`.
- **Reports**: KPI cards default to 2-col on mobile (`grid-cols-2`), numbers `text-xl md:text-3xl` with `break-words`, card padding `p-4 md:p-6`, detail header padding responsive.
- **Finance**: KPI grid 2-col on mobile with `Kpi` component now sized `text-lg md:text-3xl`, `p-4 md:p-6`, `w-5 h-5 md:w-6 md:h-6` icons. Chart containers `h-64 md:h-72`.
- **Radix Tabs (shared)**: TabsList gains `max-w-full overflow-x-auto`, TabsTrigger gains `shrink-0` — tab bars in Payments, Finance, Items now scroll horizontally when they overflow.
- **Radix Dialog (shared)**: Content now `w-[calc(100vw-1.5rem)] max-h-[calc(100vh-2rem)] overflow-y-auto p-4 md:p-6` — dialogs fit any phone, scroll internally when tall, less padding on mobile.
- **Payments**: Overdue-payment "Amount to collect + Date" row uses `flex-wrap` so date picker wraps below.
- Verified via 390×844 (iPhone 12) screenshots on Dashboard, Clients, Payments, Reports, Finance, Items, Auctions, Contracts — hamburger opens/closes drawer, tables horizontally scroll, forms usable, nothing clipped.


## Iteration 24 (2026-02) — Login Page Redesign
- Full professional restyle of `/login`. Left panel (desktop): navy hero with layered treatment (background image at 40% opacity + `bg-gradient-to-br from-[#0B1633]/95 via-[#0F1B3A]/85 to-[#1B2D5C]/70` overlay + inline SVG grain + soft `blur-3xl` accent orbs). Pulsing "Trusted Pawn & Auction House" badge, big hero title, description, and 3 glass trust chips (`10+ Years Serving TL / 24/7 Encrypted Access / USD Same-Day Cash`).
- Right panel: subtle dot-grid pattern background, elevated white card (`rounded-2xl`, backdrop-blur, soft navy shadow), email + password inputs with lucide icons inside (`Mail`, `Lock`), show/hide password toggle (Eye/EyeOff), "Signing in…" state with spinning `Loader2`, and a "Encrypted session · JWT httpOnly cookies" `ShieldCheck` reassurance under the CTA.
- Mobile: hero panel hidden, compact brand centered above the card, everything scales down cleanly. Home back-link + EN/TET toggle pinned to the top corners.
- New data-testids: `login-home-link`, `login-toggle-password`; existing ones preserved (`login-email`, `login-password`, `login-submit`, `login-error`, `login-form`, `login-brand`).


## Iteration 25 (2026-02) — Admin-Only Delete on Payments & Auctions
- Added **`DELETE /api/payments/{pid}`** (admin-only). Deletes the record, then calls `_recompute_contract_status` on the parent contract so the balance/status stays consistent. Writes an audit log entry with the receipt number, amount, type and contract_id for traceability.
- Hardened **`DELETE /api/auctions/{aid}`** (already admin-only): now also reverts the parent contract's status back to `overdue` and unsets `auction_id` when the auction was still `listed`/`auction_ready` — the workflow won't get stuck. Also writes audit log with contract number + prior status.
- **Payments.js**: red trash-outline button appears next to the PDF button on every payment row **only when `user.role === "admin"`**. Confirms with a modal explaining "This will recompute the contract balance. This action is logged." New testids: `payment-delete-{id}`.
- **Auctions.js**: same trash-outline button on every auction row for admin. Confirmation text is adaptive — if `status === "sold"` it warns that the invoice/sale won't be reversed; otherwise it explains the contract will revert to overdue so it can be re-listed or reactivated. New testids: `auction-delete-{id}`.
- Verified via curl: admin delete → 200 & record gone; unauth → 401; cashier → 403 "Admin role required" on both endpoints.


## Iteration 26 (2026-02) — EN↔TET Translation Gap Fix
- **Bug** (user report): "when change to Tetum no translates" — several UI strings stayed in English after selecting TET.
- Added 22 new i18n keys to `/app/frontend/src/lib/i18n.js` (both `en` and `tet` blocks): `login_subtitle`, `login_workspace_body`, `login_years_label`, `login_encrypted_label`, `login_sameday_label`, `login_signing_in`, `login_encrypted_note`, `monthly_trends_sub`, `contracts_past_due`, `treasury`, `finance_cash_on_hand`, `finance_capital_outstanding`, `finance_expenses_lifetime`, `finance_net_profit`, `finance_cash_flow`, `finance_expenses_by_cat`, `detail`, `principal_left`, `interest_left`, `amount_to_collect`, `receipt`.
- Replaced hardcoded English strings with `t()` calls in Login.js (workspace body, 3 trust chip labels, `Signing in…`, subtitle, encrypted note), Dashboard.js (trend/overdue chart subtitles), Finance.js (Treasury eyebrow, 4 KPI labels, cash-flow & expenses-by-category chart titles), Reports.js (Detail eyebrow), Payments.js (Principal/Interest Left, Amount to collect, Receipt column header).
- Removed the two `status` duplicate keys I introduced (kept the pre-existing ones at lines 33 / 326).
- **Testing agent verdict** (report iter_22): **15/15 targeted strings switch correctly**, EN↔TET reversal + localStorage `fp_lang` persistence confirmed. **Bug RESOLVED**.


## Iteration 27 (2026-02) — Services Page Image Fixes
- **Bug** (user report with screenshot): Heavy Equipment ("Garantia Pezadu") card showed a broken image icon on /services; testing agent also caught that the Car ("Karreta") card image was actually a UK "Bond Street" underground sign — not a car.
- Root cause: two hardcoded Unsplash URLs were either 404 (heavy) or crop-mismatched (car).
- Fix:
  - `Services.js` `heavy.img`: was `photo-1581093458791-9d15482442f6` (404) → now `photo-1591768793355-74d04bb6608f` (semi-trailer truck — fits "Kamiaun Pezadu / heavy duty truck").
  - `Services.js` `car.img`: was `photo-1549924231-f129b911e442` (Bond Street sign after auto-crop) → now `photo-1533473359331-0135ef1b58bf` (Ford Expedition SUV — fits "car/SUV/pickup/commercial vehicle").
  - `Home.js` `pez` category tile: updated to the same semi-trailer truck for consistency.
  - Every URL validated first via curl (200 OK) + AI image content check before committing.
- **Testing agent verdict** (report iter_25): **100% pass, 0 issues, retest_needed: false**. All 5 service card images load with contextually appropriate content; Home pez tile regression check also passed.


## Iteration 28 (2026-02) — Member Card PDF Auth Fix
- **Bug** (user report): The Member Card "PDF" button on the Client details modal used raw `window.open(${API_BASE}/clients/${id}/card-pdf, "_blank")`. In some browsers (Chrome new-tab GETs with SameSite httpOnly cookies) the auth cookie was stripped, so the endpoint returned 401 and the tab loaded a JSON error instead of the PDF.
- Fix in `/app/frontend/src/pages/Clients.js` `downloadCardPdf`:
  - Now uses `await api.get('/clients/{id}/card-pdf', { responseType: 'blob' })` — the shared axios instance already has `withCredentials: true` so cookies flow reliably.
  - Wraps the byte stream in a `new Blob([data], { type: 'application/pdf' })`, calls `URL.createObjectURL`, then `window.open(url, "_blank", "noopener,noreferrer")`.
  - Popup-blocker fallback: if `window.open` returns null, we create a hidden `<a href={blobUrl} download="member-card-FP-YYYY-####.pdf">` and click it.
  - Error handling: 401 shows a friendly toast ("Session expired — please sign in again."); other errors surface `response.data.detail`.
  - `URL.revokeObjectURL` cleanup after 60s to release memory.
- Backend endpoint unchanged — still protected via `Depends(require_module('clients'))`.
- **Testing agent verdict** (report iter_26): **100% pass, 0 issues, retest_needed: false**. Verified with a real admin session on `FP-2026-0001`: PDF opens correctly, payments-row PDF anchor still works, 401 toast path also verified.


## Iteration 29 (2026-02) — Client Photo Deployment Fix (Storage-Key URLs + Public Verify)
- **Bug** (user report from deployment): Client photos not displayed. `photo_url` DB field stores storage keys like `fatin-penhores/uploads/<id>/<uuid>.jpg`, but the frontend was doing `${API_BASE}/files/${photo_url}` which only works for that exact shape — absolute URLs and `/api/files/...` paths broke.
- **Frontend fix** — `/app/frontend/src/lib/api.js` new export `fileUrl(pathOrKey)`:
  - Absolute URL (`https://...`) → returned as-is
  - `/api/...` path → prefixed with `BACKEND_URL`
  - `/files/...` path → prefixed with `${API_BASE}`
  - Anything else (storage key) → returns `${API_BASE}/files/<key>`
  - Applied in `Clients.js` (list thumbnail + details modal image) and `VerifyMember.js` (public card preview).
- **Deployment issue #2 discovered by testing agent** (iter_27): the `/api/files/{path}` endpoint requires auth, so anonymous QR-scan visitors on `/verify/:token` always saw a broken image, and ReportLab's HTTP-fetch inside the server for embedding the photo in the Member Card PDF also failed.
- **Fixes** (iter_29):
  - New endpoint `GET /api/public/verify/{token}/photo` — no auth — streams object-storage bytes for the token's active card via `objstore.get_object(storage_key)`. Absolute URLs get a 307 redirect. 404 for unknown/short tokens.
  - `GET /api/public/verify/{token}` now returns `photo_url` as a full public URL pointing at the new public photo endpoint (`${PUBLIC_BASE_URL}/api/public/verify/<token>/photo`) so anonymous visitors never hit the auth-protected `/api/files/`.
  - `member_card_pdf` endpoint now loads `photo_bytes` directly via `objstore.get_object(storage_key)` when `photo_url` is a storage key / `/api/files/...` path, and passes them to `build_member_card_pdf(..., photo_bytes=...)`. Absolute URLs still fetched via HTTP as before.
  - `build_member_card_pdf` accepts new optional `photo_bytes` kwarg that short-circuits the urllib fetch.
- **Testing agent verdict** (report iter_28): **100% pass (backend 13/13, frontend 100%), 0 issues, retest_needed: false**. Verified in incognito: /verify/:token renders the photo without auth cookies. Admin thumbnails still work same-origin. Member Card PDF now embeds the actual photo (byte-delta confirmed).


## Iteration 30 (2026-02) — Payments UX + Rule A Interest Math
- **Business rule change** (Article 4): Interest is billed per **strict calendar month with a 1-day grace**. First month always billed (min 1). Payment on the monthly anniversary of the start date = same month. Payment 1 day past = new full month kicks in.
  - Examples: Jul 10 → Aug 10 = 1 month · Jul 10 → Aug 11 = 2 · Jul 20 → Aug 20 = 1 · Jul 20 → Aug 21 = 2 · Jul 1 → Jul 15 = 1.
  - Replaces the older `ceil(days_elapsed / 30)` rule.
- **Backend changes** (`/app/backend/server.py`):
  - New import `from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta`.
  - New helper `_months_billed(start, payment_date)` — implements Rule A.
  - `_recompute_contract_status` uses `_months_billed(...)` for `months_elapsed`; `next_interest_date = contract_start + relativedelta(months=months_elapsed) + timedelta(days=1)` (points at the day the next month kicks in).
- **Frontend changes** (`/app/frontend/src/pages/Payments.js`):
  - **New Payment dialog** summary card is now 4 metrics wide: **Interest Left** (new), Total Due, Paid, Remaining Balance. New testids: `np-interest-remaining`, `np-total-due`, `np-paid`, `np-remaining`.
  - **Disbursements table** got 2 new columns (data-appears only on the disbursement tab): **Interest / month** (`loan × rate/100`) with a `(10%)` or `(15%)` rate badge, and **Due date**. Non-disbursement tables (Payments, Overdue) unchanged.
  - Payment types (Full / Partial / Interest only) and manual Amount field unchanged — already met spec.
- **i18n**: new key `interest_per_month` (EN: "Interest / month", TET: "Juru / fulan").
- **Tests**:
  - NEW `/app/backend/tests/test_iter22_interest_rule.py` — 12 unit tests for `_months_billed` covering all edge cases (same-day, first-month, anniversary, one-day-past, end-of-month starts, leap year, payment-before-start).
  - UPDATED `/app/backend/tests/test_iter20_monthly_interest.py` — `TestArticle4MonthsElapsed` and `TestNextInterestDate` now assert Rule A instead of the old `ceil(days/30)`; canary test derives the expected value dynamically so it stays green as time moves forward.
- **Testing agent verdict** (report iter_29): **100% pass — backend 47/47 (12 unit + 5 integration + 30 regression), frontend 100%, retest_needed: false**. Final local run: 27/27 pytest tests green.


## Iteration 31 (2026-02) — Interest Calculation Explainer on Receipt PDF
- `build_receipt_pdf` now renders a soft-indigo "Oinsá ami sura interese-nia · How your interest was calculated" block right after the amber Next Payment note.
- Content (bilingual EN/TET):
  - Contract Start · Payment Date
  - Billing Months (Article 4) — e.g. "2 months · 2 fulan"
  - Rate × Loan (per month) — e.g. $150.00
  - Interest Charged — inline expression like `2 × $150.00 = $300.00`
  - Explainer footer explaining Rule A (anniversary = same month, +1 day = new month).
- Wrapped in try/except so a bad field never breaks receipt generation.
- Skipped on disbursement receipts (already gated by `not is_disbursement`).
- Verified: PDF now embeds the block; AI-inspection of a real receipt confirmed all 5 rows render correctly on the indigo panel with the bilingual explainer paragraph below.


## Iteration 32 (2026-02) — WhatsApp Overdue Reminders now include interest math
- **Extended templates** `_MSG_EN` and `_MSG_TET` in `/app/backend/reminders.py` to include the same Rule A interest math the receipt PDF shows:
  - Line 1: brand
  - Line 2: `Hello {name}` / `Ola {name}`
  - Line 3: `Contract {short_number} is {days} days overdue.`
  - Line 4: `Owed today: ${loan} + {months}×${per_month} interest = ${total_due}.`
  - Line 5: `On {next_month_date} interest rises to ${next_interest_total}.`
  - Line 6: `Please pay within {days_left} more days to avoid auction.`
  - Line 7: WhatsApp footer
  - Both languages stay ≈ 250 chars, well under WhatsApp's 1024 free-form limit.
- **Refactor** — extracted `_months_billed` into `deps.py` as `months_billed(start, payment_date)` so both `server.py` and `reminders.py` share the same Rule A math (no circular import). `server.py` still exposes the old alias `_months_billed` for internal callers/tests.
- **Reminder scheduler** loads `contract_date` in its DB projection and calls the shared helper. `days_left` calc unchanged (max(0, 10 - days)).
- **Tests** — NEW `/app/backend/tests/test_iter23_reminder_body.py` (5 tests): EN body math, TET body math + language, length ≤ 500 chars, `_short_contract` helper, business-owner concrete scenario (Jul 10 → Aug 5 = 1×$50=$550, next 2026-08-11 = $100).
- **Testing agent verdict** (report iter_30): **100% pass — backend 62/62 (5 iter23 unit + 12 iter22 unit + 15 iter20 unit + 3 iter30 integration + 27 iter17 regression), 0 issues, retest_needed: false**. Scheduler boots cleanly. Admin `POST /api/reminders/run?force=true` returns a valid summary. Rule A math validated end-to-end via GET /api/contracts/{id}.


## Iteration 33 (2026-02) — A11y + TET Translation Polish + Ad-hoc WhatsApp Preview & Send
- **A11y fix** — Added `<DialogDescription className="sr-only">` (or visible where appropriate) to every admin Dialog to resolve Radix's `aria-describedby` console warning. Files touched: `Payments.js` (New Payment + Overdue Payment), `Clients.js` (Create/Edit + Details), `Auctions.js` (Mark Sold), `Contracts.js` (New Contract + Reactivate + new WA Preview modal).
- **TET translation gap on Payments**:
  - Type badges in Payments/Overdue/Disbursement tables now render via `t(r.type)` instead of the raw enum string — so `full`, `partial`, `interest_only`, `disbursement`, `overdue_full`, `overdue_interest_pen`, `overdue_penalty_only` all switch to the Tetum labels (Kompletu / Parsiál / Juru Deit / Entrega Empréstimu / etc.).
  - New i18n keys added in both EN and TET blocks in `i18n.js` for badge labels and the `disbursements` tab title. Tab now displays `Entrega Empréstimu (15)` under TET.
- **Ad-hoc "Preview & Send" WhatsApp reminder** — cashiers/staff can now review + edit the Rule A math message body before sending, rather than firing the templated message blindly. Lives on the Contracts page per-contract action button (both pre-auction table `pa-whatsapp-{id}` and main table `contract-whatsapp-{id}`).
  - **Backend** — `/app/backend/reminders.py` gained `build_reminder_body(contract, client_name, language, today=None)` which returns `{body, days, months, per_month, total_due, next_month_date, language}`. Both the daily scheduler and the new ad-hoc endpoints reuse it, so the message math never drifts.
  - Two new endpoints (both authenticated):
    - `POST /api/whatsapp/preview` — returns the rendered body + client name/phone + Rule A metadata for the given `contract_id` + `language` (`en`/`tet`).
    - `POST /api/whatsapp/adhoc-send` — sends a free-form (optionally edited) body to `to_phone` (defaulting to client's phone) via `wapp.send_text`. Falls back to `mocked` when Meta creds aren't configured. Writes an audit log + a `whatsapp_log` row with `template="adhoc_text"`.
  - **Frontend** (`Contracts.js`) — `sendWhatsApp` no longer fires-and-forgets; it opens a new `wa-preview-dialog` modal that fetches `/whatsapp/preview`, shows a meta pill (Contract#, Client, Days overdue, Total due), lets the user tweak the `To` phone, switch language (EN/TET dropdown), edit the message body in a `Textarea`, hit `Regenerate` to reset from the template, and finally `Send` via `/whatsapp/adhoc-send`. Character counter + disabled Send while empty. New testids: `wa-preview-dialog`, `wa-to-phone`, `wa-lang`, `wa-body`, `wa-regenerate`, `wa-send`.
- **Tests** — NEW `/app/backend/tests/test_iter24_whatsapp_adhoc.py` (6 tests): EN preview shape + Rule A math verified against a 45-day-old contract (months=2, total_due=$600), TET preview language check, unknown-contract 404, auth required, mocked adhoc-send round-trip, empty-body rejection. **All 6 PASS.** Combined regression: iter22 + iter23 + iter20 unit tests → 32/32 PASS.


## Iteration 35 (2026-02) — Rule M1 (Method 1 payment allocation)
The business owner clarified that partial payments should follow Method 1
(interest-first, then principal) — standard lending accounting practice. This
correctly rewards clients for early partial payments by lowering next-month
interest on the remaining balance.

### Business rule (verified against owner examples)
- **Payment allocation (Method 1):** Interest Paid = MIN(payment, unpaid_interest);
  Principal Paid = MAX(payment − unpaid_interest, 0).
- **Month 1 interest** = 10% × original loan (Rule A anchor — one full month
  always guaranteed).
- **Month N > 1 interest** = 10% × Remaining Principal at Month N anchor
  (declining balance — never compounds unpaid interest per owner's
  "no aggressive compound" instruction).
- **No compounding on delinquency:** If client pays nothing, next month's
  interest is still 10% × Principal (not 10% × Outstanding).

### Business owner examples (all verified end-to-end)
- **Example 1 — $3,000 loan, $1,000 partial:**
  - Interest paid: $300, Principal paid: $700, Principal remaining: $2,300
  - Next month interest: **$230** (10% × $2,300) ✅
  - Total if unpaid: $2,300 + $230 = $2,530
- **Example 2 — $3,000 loan, $300 interest-only:**
  - Interest paid: $300, Principal paid: $0, Principal remaining: $3,000
  - Next month interest: **$300** ✅
- **No-payment case:** Next month interest: **$300** (NOT $330 — no compound) ✅

### Implementation
- New field `interest_rule` on the `contracts` collection:
  - `"M1"` (default for new contracts) → interest-first allocation
  - `"M2"` (legacy default when field absent) → all-to-principal allocation
- `services.py._recompute_contract_status` — rewritten with event-driven
  chronological walk. Merges month-anchor events with payment events, walks in
  date order, and applies the M1/M2 allocation rule per contract.
- Contract creation (`POST /api/contracts`) sets `interest_rule="M1"` on all
  new contracts. Existing contracts remain on legacy M2 semantics — no
  retroactive impact.
- `pdf_utils.py` receipt "How your interest was calculated" block now shows
  the per-month itemized breakdown (e.g. `$300 + $230 + $230 + ...`) when the
  hybrid declining-balance rates apply.
- `reminders.py.build_reminder_body` prefers the recomputed contract's
  values so WhatsApp/email reminders show the correct M1 totals.
- Frontend `Payments.js` disbursement tooltip updated: "Current-month interest
  (Rule M1: interest-first allocation, principal-remaining base)."

### Tests (all passing)
- NEW `tests/test_iter27_rule_m1.py` (5 tests):
  - Example 1: partial $1000 → interest paid=$300, principal paid=$700, next month=$230 ✅
  - Example 2: interest-only $300 → next month=$300 ✅
  - No compounding on delinquency: next month=$300 (not $330) ✅
  - Legacy M2 contracts: partial=principal-only, next month=$200 (backwards-compat) ✅
  - Two partials stack: month 2=$280 (10% × $2,800), month 3=$258 (10% × $2,580) ✅
- Adjusted `tests/test_iter4.py::test_partial_reduces_principal` to reflect
  M1 semantics (was asserting old M2 all-to-principal).
- Adjusted `tests/test_iter26_rule_b_hybrid.py` to explicitly pass
  `interest_rule="M2"` for backwards-compat verification.
- **Total regression: 361/367 tests pass** (6 pre-existing failures unrelated
  to this iteration — public warehouse gates + settings defaults).


## Iteration 34 (2026-02) — Phase 2 Refactor + Audit Log UI + Resend Email + Auth Extras + PWA
This is a big batch of P0/P2 backlog items shipped together. Broken down:

### P0 — Backend refactor Phase 2 (server.py split into routers)
- `services.py` NEW (~276 lines) — cross-domain helpers: `_recompute_contract_status` (Rule A interest math), `_fetch_item`, `get_settings_doc`, `_decrypted_settings`, `_send_reminder_for_contract`, `_wa_template_name`, `_wa_lang_code`, `_today_iso`, `_ym_from_iso`, `_apply_date_filter`, `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`, `ITEM_KINDS`. Prevents circular imports between routers.
- `routes/reports.py` NEW (~470 lines) — v1 + v2 endpoints, KPI aggregations, CSV/XLSX/PDF exports, all `_report_*` builders.
- `routes/finance.py` NEW (~360 lines) — funding sources CRUD + repayments + operating expenses + finance summary + 3 PDF exports.
- `routes/public.py` NEW (~149 lines) — public auction items, warehouse password gate, contact form.
- `routes/whatsapp.py` NEW (~222 lines) — WhatsApp send / preview / adhoc-send / test / logs / reminders/run.
- `routes/admin.py` NEW (~212 lines) — backup list/generate/download + health + enhanced audit log endpoints.
- `routes/auth_extra.py` NEW (~173 lines) — forgot-password / reset-password / admin manual reset.
- `server.py` shrunk from **2905 lines → 1555 lines** (~46% reduction). All API paths and behaviour unchanged.
- `models.py` deferred (keeping Pydantic models close to their handlers turned out cleaner).

### P2 — Audit Log Viewer UI (admin sees who changed what)
- Backend enhancements to `GET /api/audit-log`: added filters `action`, `actor_email` (case-insensitive substring), `date_from`, `date_to`. Added indexes on `resource`, `action`, `actor_email`.
- NEW `GET /api/audit-log/export/csv` — respects filters, returns text/csv attachment.
- NEW `GET /api/audit-log/export/pdf` — branded landscape PDF via `build_audit_log_pdf` in `pdf_utils.py` with filter summary + table.
- Full frontend rewrite `/app/frontend/src/pages/AuditLog.js` — filter bar (Resource / Action / Actor email / From / To / Limit), Reset + Apply buttons, coloured CSV / PDF export buttons, live row count in header.

### P2 — Email reminders via Resend (fallback when client has no phone)
- `resend==2.32.2` installed.
- NEW `email_svc.py` — Resend SDK wrapper with **graceful mocked fallback** (matches WhatsApp UX). Uses `asyncio.to_thread` for non-blocking sends. Two ready-made HTML templates: `render_overdue_reminder` (bilingual Rule A math body) + `render_password_reset`.
- New env vars: `RESEND_API_KEY=""` and `SENDER_EMAIL="onboarding@resend.dev"` (sandbox — verified domain later).
- Reminder scheduler (`reminders.py`) now: (a) prefers WhatsApp when phone present + WA configured, (b) **falls back to email only when client has no phone number** (per admin choice), (c) records `channel` and `recipient` in the send summary so admin can distinguish.
- MOCKED — will remain mocked until admin drops the Resend API key into `.env`.

### P2 — "Remember me" + Forgot password flow + PWA
- `auth.py` — `create_refresh_token(user_id, remember=False)` and `set_auth_cookies(..., remember=False)` now support the "Remember me" 30-day path (was hardcoded 7d). `POST /api/auth/refresh` preserves the `remember` claim from the current refresh token.
- `LoginIn` gained `remember: bool = False` — the /login endpoint honours it.
- NEW `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` — always returns generic 200 (email enumeration safe). When email exists, mints a 15-min single-use `secrets.token_urlsafe(48)`, wipes any prior unused tokens for that user, stores in `password_reset_tokens`, fires the reset link email.
- NEW `GET /api/auth/reset-token-info?token=…` — public preflight for the /reset-password page; returns masked email + expiry.
- NEW `POST /api/auth/reset-password` — consumes the token exactly once, bcrypt-hashes new password, marks `used_at`.
- NEW `POST /api/users/{id}/reset-password` — admin-only manual reset. Also invalidates any outstanding self-service tokens for that user.
- Frontend:
  - Login page: **Remember me** checkbox + **Forgot password?** link (both fully bilingual EN/TET).
  - NEW `/forgot-password` public page — email form → success card.
  - NEW `/reset-password?token=…` public page — token preflight → new password + confirm → success → auto-redirect to /login.
  - Users page: **KeyRound** (amber) icon button per row (admin-only) → `window.prompt` → `/users/{id}/reset-password`.
- PWA installability:
  - NEW `public/manifest.json` — Fatin Penhores metadata, navy theme, standalone display, `/dashboard` start URL, logo as maskable icon.
  - NEW `public/service-worker.js` — minimal install/activate handler + shell cache. **Never** caches `/api/*` — financial data always live.
  - `index.html`: `<link rel="manifest">`, apple-touch-icon, apple-mobile-web-app-* meta tags, navy `theme-color`.
  - `index.js`: SW registered only in `NODE_ENV=production` (no stale-cache annoyance in dev).
- New i18n keys (EN + TET): `remember_me`, `forgot_password`, `reset_password`, `reset_password_desc`, `reset_password_sent`, `reset_new_password`, `reset_confirm`, `reset_password_success`, `reset_link_expired`, `passwords_dont_match`, `back_to_login`.

### Tests
- NEW `tests/test_iter25_auth_extras_and_audit.py` — 8 tests covering: Remember-me 30d cookie, default 7d cookie, forgot→reset→login cycle, token single-use (410), admin manual reset happy + RBAC path, audit CSV export MIME/format, audit PDF export MIME + %PDF magic + minimum size. **All 8 PASS.**
- Regression: 350 pytest tests PASS after the refactor. 6 pre-existing failures (public auction/warehouse gates + iter2 defaults + iter27 photo sizing) are unrelated and were already failing before this session.

### Backlog cleared
- ~~P0: Refactor server.py Phase 2~~ ✅
- ~~P2: Audit log viewer UI~~ ✅
- ~~P2: Email reminders via Resend~~ ✅ (mocked until API key provided)
- ~~P2: PWA install + Remember me + Forgot password~~ ✅


## Prioritized Backlog
### P2 — UI Polish (still open)
- Color-coded tabs on Reports page (match Items/Finance).
- Recharts `ResponsiveContainer` width(-1) warning on Dashboard/Finance — wrap charts with `min-h-[300px]`.

### P3 — Enhancements
- Home page hero redesign (full Tetum match: hero copy, category mosaic, 4-step process, testimonials).
- Verify a real domain on Resend and switch `SENDER_EMAIL` away from the sandbox so we can email any client (not just the account owner).
- Tighten backend Pezadu category validation with `Literal[...]` enum.
- Hard-fail Settings PUT when `WHATSAPP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` missing (avoid silent plaintext storage).
- Split `server.py` further (auth + users + clients + items + contracts + payments + auctions) — the remaining 1555 lines are still substantial. Second refactor pass when a low-risk window opens.
- Move contract status recompute out of report GET into a background job for perf.

## Iteration 33 — Month-end Compliance Bundle (2026-02) ✅
- **Backend router** `/app/backend/routes/monthend.py`:
  - `GET /api/monthend/generate?month=YYYY-MM` → streams ZIP + persists a copy to `/app/backups/monthend/monthend-YYYY-MM.zip`. Contains Finance Summary PDF, Expenses PDF, Audit Log PDF, Treasury XLSX (3 sheets: Capital / Expenses / Summary), and a bilingual `README.txt`.
  - `GET /api/monthend/archives` → list persisted bundles (newest first).
  - `GET /api/monthend/archives/{filename}` → download persisted bundle.
  - `DELETE /api/monthend/archives/{filename}` → admin cleanup.
- **APScheduler job** `monthend_bundle` — runs on **day 1 of every month at 02:30 UTC**, generating & persisting the previous month's bundle. Exposed via `GET /api/admin/backups/schedule` (`next_monthend_run_at`).
- **Frontend**: New `MonthEndBundle` component (`/app/frontend/src/components/MonthEndBundle.js`) mounted at the bottom of Reports page — month/year selector, one-click "Generate & Download", Archives table with download buttons, next-auto-run indicator.
- **i18n**: EN + TET strings (`monthend_bundle`, `monthend_desc`, `generate_bundle`, `monthend_archives`, `next_auto_run`, `file_size`, `modified`, `download`).
- **Security**: Admin-only routes; strict `monthend-YYYY-MM.zip` filename regex prevents path traversal.
- **Audit**: Every generate/delete writes to `audit_log` with counts of rows included.
- **Tests**: `/app/backend/tests/test_iter31_monthend_bundle.py` — 6 tests (ZIP structure, PDF validity, archive listing, download, invalid month, filename traversal, unauthenticated access, scheduler exposure). **All passing.**

## Credentials
- Admin: `admin@fatinpenhores.tl` / `admin123` (see `/app/memory/test_credentials.md`).
- WhatsApp creds: set via Settings → WhatsApp Configuration. Empty = MOCKED.
- Resend: `RESEND_API_KEY=""` in `/app/backend/.env` — set to a real `re_...` key from https://resend.com/api-keys to enable actual email delivery. Empty = MOCKED.

## Iteration 53 — Business Dashboard Range Toggle (2026-02-17) ✅
Added a global **Daily / Weekly / 30d / YTD** range toggle to the top-right of `/business`. All four money KPIs reactively update — the toggle affects:
- **Total Loaned Out** — snapshot stays the same, but the sub-line now shows *New in range: $X* (disbursements within the window)
- **Interest Earned** — realized interest within the window
- **Projected Interest** — prorated forward (daily = monthly / 30, weekly = × 7 / 30, 30d = full month, YTD = months-left × cap)
- **Potential Loss** — snapshot (time-independent by design)

Backend `/api/business/metrics` now returns a `ranges` dict with `daily / weekly / 30d / ytd` sub-payloads (each containing `loaned_new`, `interest_earned`, `projected_interest`), so the client flips instantly without a re-fetch. Removed the old per-card YTD/30d toggle on the Interest KPI (superseded by the global one).

Verified: clicking Daily → labels change to "today / next 24h", clicking Weekly → "last 7 days / next 7 days", numbers update accordingly ($27,700 new in last 7d, $6,867 projected next 7d).

## Iteration 52 — Client Risk Score Pill (2026-02-17) ✅
- Backend `GET /api/clients` now enriches each client with `risk_level` (green / amber / red / none), `risk_concentration_pct`, `risk_overdue_days`, and `risk_auction_ready`, all computed in a single batched query over active/overdue/auction_ready contracts.
- **Scoring rule**: any auction_ready contract OR >15% of the total book → **red (High)**; between 5–15% or has overdue contracts → **amber (Watch)**; otherwise **green (Low)**.
- Frontend: new `<RiskPill>` component in `/clients` table with a colored dot, tier label, and inline concentration percentage. Hover title reveals the full breakdown ("X% of book · N days overdue · N auction-ready").
- Verified on current data: **141 Low, 0 Watch, 145 High, 234 dashes** (no active contracts). No N+1 queries — single `contracts.find` + in-memory rollup.

## Iteration 51 — Business Dashboard v2 (Trend Toggle + Concentration + Actual-vs-Forecast + Reminder Preview) (2026-02-17) ✅
1. **Historical Trend Toggle on Interest KPI** — new YTD / 30d pill switch inside the "Interest Earned" card. Backend `/api/business/metrics` now returns both `interest_earned_ytd` and `interest_earned_30d`; frontend flips the value + label on click without a page reload.
2. **Client Concentration Chart** — new horizontal-bar recharts chart at the bottom of `/business` showing the top 10 clients by outstanding principal, each in a distinct navy/teal/coral hue, plus a grey **"Others"** bucket so the chart always sums to 100%. Backend adds `client_concentration` array (name / principal / percent) to the metrics endpoint.
3. **Cash-Flow Actual vs Forecast** — the cash-flow chart now spans **60 days** (past 30 + next 30). Green bars = actual receipted payments over the past 30 days (from `payments` collection, disbursements excluded), navy bars = projected inflows for the next 30 days. Legend + tooltip differentiate the two. Owners can now judge whether the forecast has been trustworthy historically.
4. **Day-1 Reminder Template Preview** — new "Reminder templates" section in Settings → Daily Overdue Reminders that shows the day-1 (amber), day-7 (orange), day-9 (rose) message body with a Tetum/English toggle. `reminder_days` in `/whatsapp/reminders/status` now returns `[1, 7, 9]` and the Settings copy reads "day 1, day 7 or day 9" so operators aren't surprised by the new day-1 send.

Bonus: `client_concentration` uses a batched clients lookup (no N+1 queries).

## Iteration 50 — Business Dashboard + Cash Flow Forecast + Grace-Period Alerts (2026-02-17) ✅
Testing agent verified: **16/16 backend pytest, 100% frontend flows pass, zero regressions**.

### Backend
- New endpoint `GET /api/business/metrics` — owner-focused metrics:
  - `total_loaned_out` (Σ current_principal of active/overdue/auction_ready)
  - `interest_earned_ytd` (Σ interest_paid on payments this calendar year)
  - `projected_interest_30d` (Σ current_principal × rate for active contracts not yet at 2-month cap)
  - `potential_loss` (Σ current_principal of auction_ready contracts — worst case if sasán fails to sell)
  - `grace_period_count`, `auction_ready_count`
  - `per_loan` (top 50 largest active loans with per-loan `interest_earned` vs `interest_projected_30d`)
- New endpoint `GET /api/business/cashflow-forecast` — 30-day bucketed forecast of expected inflows based on active/overdue contract due_dates + accrued interest.
- Scheduler `REMINDER_DAYS` extended from `[7, 9]` → `[1, 7, 9]` — sends the day-1 "welcome to grace period" WhatsApp/email reminder automatically the day a contract enters overdue status.

### Frontend
- New page `/app/frontend/src/pages/BusinessDashboard.js` mounted at `/business` and linked in the sidebar (Briefcase icon between Dashboard and Clients).
- 4 KPI cards (Total Loaned Out / Interest YTD / Projected 30d / Potential Loss) — all clickable, deep-link into filtered Contracts or Reports.
- 2 status cards (Grace Period · amber / Ready for Auction · rose) — click through to `/contracts?status=overdue|auction_ready`.
- Cash-flow forecast bar chart (recharts) — 30 bars, hover tooltip shows `Due YYYY-MM-DD · Expected $N`.
- Top-20 per-loan breakdown table with contract, client, item, principal, rate, interest earned + projected, status pill.
- i18n keys added in EN/TET (`business_*`, `grace_period`, `ready_for_auction`, etc.).
- Labels are **English + Tetum only** (no Indonesian) per user preference — original design showed "Masa Tenggang / Siap Lelang" in both languages; corrected to `Grace Period / Ready for Auction` (EN) and `Períodu Toleránsia / Prontu ba Leilaun` (TET).

### Verified numbers on current data
- Total Loaned Out: **$544,700**
- Projected 30d interest: **$29,430**
- Potential Loss: **$188,900** (150 auction-ready contracts)
- Cash Flow Forecast (next 30 days): **$324,110** expected inflow

## Iteration 49 — Backlog Cleanup Batch (2026-02-17) ✅
Testing agent verified: **100% frontend flows (6/6), 5/5 new backend tests pass, 29/30 legacy pytest** (1 pre-existing unrelated 401 on locked public listing).

1. **Item Filter Chips** — new `FilterChips` component in `Items.js` with 4 status chips (All / In Stock / Pawned / Sold), each with a count badge. Renders on all 4 kind tabs (car/motorcycle/electronic/pezadu). Verified: clicking "sold" filters 517→0 rows on current data.
2. **Rule Preview Card** — new `RulePreviewCard` inside the New Contract dialog shows the Article 4 max obligation live as loan/rate change. Example: $3,000 @ 10% → monthly $300, interest×2 $600, penalty $300, **Total Selu max $3,900**. Empty state prompts "Fill in loan amount and interest rate…".
3. **Filter Pill on Payments & Auctions** —
   - Payments: `?contract=CTR-XXXX` URL filter, pill shows "Filtered by contract · N of M payments · Clear ×".
   - Auctions: `?client=Name` case-insensitive URL filter, pill shows "Filtered by client · N auctions · Clear ×".
4. **PDF Preview Everywhere** — Contracts (contract PDF + pre-auction PDF) and Payments now open the reusable `PdfPreviewDialog` (iframe preview + Download button) instead of directly downloading the PDF. Existing Auction and Finance-Invoice previews unchanged.
5. **Fix Orphan Auction Group** — `list_auctions` enrichment now labels orphans as `Deleted Contract · CTR-XXXX` (contract deleted) or `Unlinked · CTR-XXXX` (contract exists, no client_id) instead of grouping them all under "—". Verified: 34/76 orphan rows correctly labelled, 0 empty client_name.

**Also**: Motorcycle default interest rate changed **15% → 10%** to match Car (per user request). Backend `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`, `SettingsIn`, live DB `settings` doc, and frontend `DEFAULT_RATE_FALLBACK` all updated. Existing motorcycle contracts keep their historical stored rate (27 legacy at 15%, 1 new at 10%).

**a11y fix**: added hidden `DialogDescription` inside `PdfPreviewDialog` to silence the Radix "Missing Description" console warning.

## Iteration 48 — Tap-to-Dial Phone Cells (2026-02-17) ✅
- Every `phone` column in the Reports table now renders as a **navy `tel:` link** (opens the dialer on mobile / FaceTime/Skype/etc. on desktop) followed by a small copy-to-clipboard button that shows a "Copied +670..." toast.
- New helper component `PhoneCell` in `Reports.js`. `fmtCell(col, v, row)` dispatches to it whenever `col === "phone"`.
- Verified on the Overdue tab: **163 phone cells, 163 copy buttons**, first href correctly `tel:+670700111`. Zero console warnings.

## Iteration 47 — Overdue Report Enrichment + Auction-Eligible Pill (2026-02-17) ✅
- **Overdue tab now includes `auction_ready` contracts too** — they were previously hidden from this view even though they need auctioneer follow-up. The Overdue tab is the single place staff go to see everyone who owes money past due date.
- **New columns on the Overdue report**: `client_name`, `phone`, `contract_date`, `days_overdue`, `total_amount_due`, plus the existing item brand/model/type. Backend `_enrich_contracts_with_client()` helper attaches full_name + phone via a batched client lookup (no N+1 queries).
- **`is_auction_eligible` flag** computed server-side: true when status = `auction_ready` OR (days_overdue > 10 AND months_elapsed >= 2). The frontend renders a red **AUCTION ELIGIBLE** pill next to the status badge on those rows — clear visual cue that further waiting won't add accrual pressure per the new Article 4 cap.
- New KPIs on this report: `total_due` (sum of all `total_amount_due`) and `auction_eligible` count.
- Column short-labels added for `due_date`, `days_overdue`, `client_name`, `phone` so header widths stay tight.
- Verified: 168 rows visible on the Overdue tab, 150 rows have the AUCTION ELIGIBLE pill (all auction_ready + long-overdue rows). Total Due column shows correctly ($2,600 on typical car contracts).

## Iteration 46 — Car Fields + Month Filter + Article 4 Interest Cap (2026-02-17) ✅
Three adjustments delivered — testing agent verified 11/11 backend pytest, all frontend flows pass.

1. **Car & Motorcycle fields**: `engine_cc` (int) and `transmission` (str: manual/automatic) added to `CarIn` and `MotorcycleIn` Pydantic models. Frontend Items page renders them as new form fields (Engine Capacity CC input + Transmission select). Backward compatible with existing records.
2. **Contracts month filter**: New URL-driven `?month=YYYY-MM` dropdown at the top of the Contracts page. Options are dynamically built from the months present in the dataset (only months that actually have contracts are listed). Filter pill shows active month + count; Clear × removes both month AND status filters at once. i18n: `all_months` (EN/TET).
3. **Article 4 interest cap (CRITICAL rule change)**: `services.py` now caps `months_elapsed` at 2 — pawn contracts can NEVER accrue more than 2 months of interest per Article 4 "Prazu Kontratu · 2 fulan maximu". A contract that stays dormant for 900 days still owes only 2 × monthly_interest. PDF Article 2 rewritten: removed the "interese fulan tolu" (3-month forward) addition; new text reads "interese fulan 2 maximu + multa" — matching the printed rules card.

**Verified via curl**: A 903-day-overdue car contract at 15% rate on $500 principal now shows `months_elapsed=2`, `per_month_billed=[75, 75]`, `interest_charged=$150` (= exactly 20% of $500 = 2 × 15%). Previously interest would have accrued indefinitely.

## Iteration 45 — Owner Snapshot PDF (2026-02-17) ✅
- New endpoint `GET /api/dashboard/snapshot/pdf` (module-gated by `dashboard`) generates a one-page "Owner Snapshot" PDF containing:
  - 3×2 KPI grid (Clients / Active / Overdue / Total Loan / Total Payments / Profit) with month-over-month arrows (▲ ▼) on the money row
  - 6-month multi-line trend chart (Loans / Payments / Interest) using ReportLab `HorizontalLineChart` — Navy / Green / Coral series
  - Overdue-by-item-type bar chart in Rose
- New `build_dashboard_snapshot_pdf(summary, trends, generated_at)` in `pdf_utils.py`. Refactored server.py to expose `_dashboard_summary_data()` and `_dashboard_trends_data()` helpers so the PDF endpoint reuses the exact same aggregation as the JSON endpoints (no duplicate math).
- Frontend: new **"Owner Snapshot PDF"** button in the Dashboard header (data-testid=`dashboard-snapshot-btn`) that opens the existing `PdfPreviewDialog` with `url=/api/dashboard/snapshot/pdf` → users see the PDF preview first, then choose Download.
- Verified via curl: endpoint returns HTTP 200, 46KB payload with `%PDF-1.4` magic header. Frontend dialog opens with correct title + Download button.

## Iteration 44 — KPI Sparklines (2026-02-17) ✅
- Added ultra-compact 6-month sparklines (recharts `LineChart`, no axes/grid/tooltip, 96×32px, animation off) next to the trend pill on **Total Loan / Total Payments / Profit** KPI cards.
- Colors match each KPI tone: Loan Navy `#1B2D5C`, Payments Green `#4C7F62`, Profit Coral `#C17767`.
- Component `MiniSpark` in Dashboard.js accepts `data`, `dataKey`, `color`, `testid`. Rendered only when `trends.months` is populated, so first paint is clean.
- Verified: 3 sparklines render (`kpi-loan-spark`, `kpi-payments-spark`, `kpi-profit-spark`), each showing the last 6 monthly buckets of the trends payload.

## Iteration 43 — KPI Trend Badges (2026-02-17) ✅
- Added a small trend pill under **Total Loan / Total Payments / Profit** KPI cards showing month-over-month delta pulled from the existing `/dashboard/trends` endpoint (last 6 monthly buckets).
- Green (↗) when the direction is favourable, rose (↘) when unfavourable. `invertTrend: true` supported for cards where an increase is bad (e.g. future Overdue trend). "no baseline" pill when the prior month is 0 to avoid divide-by-zero.
- New helper `monthlyDelta(months, key)` and new component `TrendBadge` (in Dashboard.js). Values are rounded to 1 decimal.
- Verified: `kpi-loan-trend = +82.3%`, `kpi-payments-trend = +1729.2%`, `kpi-profit-trend = +86.7%` — all rendering as green pills on the current dataset.

## Iteration 42 — Clickable KPI Cards + URL-driven Report Tabs (2026-02-17) ✅
- All 6 top KPI cards on the Dashboard now deep-link into the relevant page:
  - Total Clients → `/clients`
  - Active Contracts → `/contracts?status=active`
  - Overdue Contracts → `/contracts?status=overdue`
  - Total Loan Amount → `/reports?tab=financial`
  - Total Payments → `/reports?tab=payments`
  - Profit / Interest → `/reports?tab=financial`
- Reports page now reads `?tab=<key>` on mount (validated against `TABS`) and writes it back whenever the user switches tabs via a new `changeTab` helper. Browser back/forward and shared URLs preserve the tab.
- Verified: kpi-loan → `?tab=financial` (Financial tab teal-active), kpi-payments → `?tab=payments` (Payments tab green-active). No console errors.

## Iteration 41 — Clickable Dashboard Cards (2026-02-17) ✅
- Each of the 5 status cards on the Dashboard is now a `<Link>` that jumps to a pre-filtered view:
  - Active / Overdue / Redeemed / Auction Ready → `/contracts?status=<value>`
  - Auction → `/auctions`
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/Contracts.js` reads `?status=X` via `useSearchParams`, filters `rows` accordingly, and shows a "Filtered by status: X · N of M · Clear ×" pill at the top of the main table. Clicking Clear removes the query param.
- Empty state respects the filter ("No contracts with status \"auction_ready\"") instead of the generic message.
- Verified: clicking Auction Ready (148) on the Dashboard now lands on `/contracts?status=auction_ready` with all 148 rows shown and the pill visible.

## Iteration 40 — Dashboard/Finance/Auctions/Payments UX Batch (2026-02-17) ✅
User requested 5 adjustments — all implemented and validated by testing_agent (9/9 backend pytest, all frontend flows pass):

1. **Dashboard "Auction Ready" card** — new stat card (gavel icon, amber tone, data-testid=`stat-auction-ready`) between Overdue and Redeemed. Backend `/api/dashboard/summary` now returns `auction_ready_contracts` counting contracts with status = `auction_ready` separately from `auction`.
2. **Finance → Invoices delete** — new endpoint `DELETE /api/invoices/{iid}` (admin-only, `require_admin` dependency). Best-effort clears `invoice_id`/`invoice_number` on the linked auction and writes an audit-log entry. Frontend adds a red trash-icon button per row (admin only).
3. **Auction → Sold profit flow** — updated `/app/backend/routes/finance.py` `gross_profit` formula from `interest_received + total_penalty + auction_realized_profit − auction_realized_loss` to `interest_received + total_penalty + auction_interest_profit`. This matches user's rule: whole `sold_price` → Cash on Hand, `interest_fee` portion → Net Profit.
4. **Auctions page** — rewrote to group by `client_name` (one row per pawner, expand chevron reveals items). Backend `list_auctions` now enriches each auction with `client_name` and `client_id` via contract → client lookup. Invoice PDF button opens the new `PdfPreviewDialog` (iframe preview with a Download button) instead of directly opening the raw PDF URL.
5. **Payments section** — `PaymentsTable` grouped by `contract_id` on all three tabs (Payments, Overdue, Disbursements). Summary row shows count / total / latest date; expand reveals individual payment rows with PDF + delete actions.

**New file**: `/app/frontend/src/components/PdfPreviewDialog.js` — reusable iframe-based preview modal. Currently wired to Auction invoices and Finance invoices; can be extended app-wide later.
**i18n**: Added `client_name` (Kliente / Client) and `preview` (Haree / Preview) keys.
**React key fix**: replaced `<>` fragment shorthand inside `.map()` with `<Fragment key=...>` in Auctions.js and Payments.js (silences React "unique key" warning).

## Iteration 39 — Financial Report Table Fit + Overdue Audio Chime (2026-02-17) ✅
- **Fix**: Financial report table no longer overflows past its card container. Root cause: `<th>` cells were `whitespace-nowrap` and column labels like "Original Loan Amount" / "Interest Received" / "Penalty Outstanding" pushed the total table width beyond `1280px`.
- **Changes** in `/app/frontend/src/pages/Reports.js`:
  - Added `COL_SHORT_LABEL` map for verbose columns (Original Loan, Interest Rcvd, Penalty Due, etc.).
  - `<th>` now allows header text to wrap (`whitespace-normal break-words`) with `align-bottom` + `leading-tight` for a compact 1–2 line header row.
  - Header padding tightened to `px-2` (from `px-2.5 py-2.5`).
- **Result** at 1280×800 viewport: tableWidth 958 == wrapWidth 958, no horizontal overflow. Body still uses `overflow-x-auto` so narrower screens scroll gracefully.
- **New**: Subtle WebAudio 2-tone chime (A5→E5, ~0.4s, gain 0.08) plays once per browser session in `/app/frontend/src/layouts/AdminLayout.js` when polled overdue count first crosses `REPORTS_ALERT_THRESHOLD` (15). Flag stored in `sessionStorage` (`overdue-chime-played`); auto-resets if count falls below threshold so a subsequent crossing re-alerts.
- No backend changes; no schema changes; no dependency changes.


## Iteration 54 — Article 8 Penalty Rate Matches Interest Rate (2026-02-22) ✅
User feedback: on the contract PDF, Article 8 (Multa Atrasu) was hard-coded to 10% of current principal even when Article 3 charged 15% interest (electronics) — the penalty rate should mirror the interest rate.

### Fix
- **`services.py:_recompute_contract_status`**: `penalty_rate` now defaults to the contract's own `interest_rate` (`float(contract.get("penalty_rate") or rate)`). Contracts that explicitly store a `penalty_rate` field still respect it.
- **`pdf_utils.build_contract_pdf`**: same default (`penalty_rate = float(contract.get("penalty_rate") or rate or 10.0)`), so Article 8's wording and math automatically reflect Car 10%, Motorcycle 10%, Electronic 15%.
- **`DEFAULT_TNC_EN` / `DEFAULT_TNC_TET`**: rule 7 rewritten from "10% of the original loan amount" to "matches the contract's interest rate (Car 10%, Motorcycle 10%, Electronic 15%) and is calculated on the current principal". Rule 5 also updated (Motorcycle 15% → 10%).
- **One-time migration** at startup: clears cached `penalty_charged` / `penalty_outstanding` on non-redeemed contracts that don't have an explicit `penalty_rate`, so recompute_financials recalculates them against the interest rate. Uses `db.migrations` collection with `_id: "penalty_rate_2026_02"` for idempotency.

### Verification (live)
- Car @ 10%: Article 8 shows "multa **10%** … USD $500.00" (10% × $5,000 principal) ✅
- Motorcycle @ 15%: Article 8 shows "multa **15%** … USD $150.00" (15% × $1,000 principal) ✅
- Electronic @ 10%: penalty $10 = 10% × $100 ✅
- Motorcycle @ 10%: penalty $100 = 10% × $1,000 ✅

## Iteration 53 — Batch B: Grace Nudge + Public Catalogue + Snapshot QR (2026-02-22) ✅
Three follow-ups from Batch A backlog. Server Split (item #4 requested) is **deferred** to a dedicated session — full split of `server.py` (2,144 lines / 60 route decorators) is a multi-hour pure refactor with high regression risk; the user-facing value here is zero and it deserves its own testing pass.

### 1. Grace Period WhatsApp Nudge — Friendly Day-1
- `reminders.py`: added `_MSG_GRACE_EN` / `_MSG_GRACE_TET` — softer, reassuring tone that explicitly mentions the 10-day grace window and drops the "next month interest rises" alarm.
- `build_reminder_body` now picks the grace template when `days_overdue == 1`; falls back to the existing hard-warning template for days 7 & 9.
- Validated live: preview for contract CTR-2026-0430 (day 1 grace) returns "No stress — you're now in the 10-day grace period. You have 9 days to pay and keep your item."

### 2. Public Auction Catalogue Page
- New public no-auth endpoint **`GET /api/public/auction-catalogue/pdf`** in `routes/public.py`. Same PDF as the admin catalogue; contains zero PII.
- `pages/public/AuctionPublic.js`: added a **"Download Catalogue (PDF)"** button in the unlocked header AND — critically — an **"Or download the printable catalogue (no password)"** link on the locked screen so passers-by can grab the file without ever unlocking the listing.
- Verified: unauthenticated `curl` returns HTTP 200 + valid `%PDF-1.4` (60 KB).

### 3. Owner Snapshot PDF — QR Code
- `pdf_utils.build_dashboard_snapshot_pdf` now accepts `dashboard_url` and, when set, embeds a 2.4 cm × 2.4 cm QR code (brand-navy `#1B2D5C`) in the top-right of the first page with a "Scan for live view" caption.
- `server.py:/dashboard/snapshot/pdf` derives the frontend origin from `Referer` / `Origin` headers and passes `{origin}/business` as the QR target.
- Uses existing `qrcode==8.2` dependency (no new install). Falls back silently to title-only header if QR generation fails.
- Validated: PDF grew from ~44 KB → 48 KB with valid `%PDF-1.4` header.

### 4. Server Split — Deferred
- Scope: 2,144 lines with 60 `@api.*` decorators to split into `routes/{clients,items,contracts,payments,auctions,dashboard,business}.py`.
- Reason for deferral: pure refactor with **zero user-visible value**; the current file works fine; and doing it alongside three real features risks masking regressions.
- Recommended follow-up: dedicated session that (a) extracts one module at a time, (b) runs the full `backend/tests` pytest suite after each extraction, (c) uses testing_agent_v3 for end-to-end validation.

## Iteration 52 — Real Grace Period Status + Share Snapshot + Auction Catalogue (2026-02-22) ✅
Batch A of user's backlog request. Three independent features:

### 1. Real Grace Period Status
- Introduced a **persisted `grace_period`** contract status (previously the 1–10 day window was reusing the `overdue` label).
- **`services.py`**: `recompute_financials` now writes `status = "grace_period"` (instead of `"overdue"`) for contracts 1–10 days past due. Contracts >10 days remain `auction_ready`.
- **Startup migration** in `server.py:on_startup`: idempotent `update_many({"status": "overdue"}, {"$set": {"status": "grace_period"}})`. First run migrated 19 contracts; subsequent runs no-op.
- **Backward-compat**: every backend tuple/`$in` that included `"overdue"` now also includes `"grace_period"` (`server.py`, `reminders.py`, `whatsapp.py`, `reports.py`, `migration_audit.py`). Legacy DB records/tests referencing `"overdue"` still function.
- **Dashboard summary** returns both `overdue_contracts` (legacy alias) and new `grace_period_contracts` field.
- **Reports overdue tab** now returns both `grace_period` (19) and `auction_ready` (150) = 169 rows total.
- **Frontend Contracts**: filter accepts `?status=grace_period` or `?status=overdue` (treated as alias); StatusBadge maps `grace_period` → "grace period" pill with amber styling.
- **Dashboard links** now use `/contracts?status=grace_period` for the Overdue KPI + Stat cards. BusinessDashboard grace card also links to grace_period.
- Payments/Contracts action guards (reactivate, move-to-auction, WhatsApp) now accept `grace_period` alongside `overdue`.

### 2. Share Snapshot
- Business Dashboard range toggle is now **URL-driven** via `?range=daily|weekly|30d|ytd`. Direct visits to `/business?range=weekly` open with Weekly pre-selected.
- New **"Share Snapshot"** button (`data-testid="share-snapshot-btn"`) copies the exact current URL to the clipboard using `navigator.clipboard.writeText`. Falls back to `window.prompt` if clipboard API is blocked.
- Toast confirmation ("Share link copied to clipboard" / TET) + inline check-icon swap for 2 s.
- i18n keys: `share_snapshot`, `share_snapshot_hint`, `share_link_copied`, `copied` (EN + TET).

### 3. Auction Catalogue PDF
- New **`build_auction_catalogue_pdf`** in `pdf_utils.py`: A4 portrait, branded header, one row per auction-eligible item with columns: Ref (contract number), Type, Description (brand · model · year · color · plate), Market Value, Min. Bid (70% of market).
- **Excludes all client PII** — safe to post on public noticeboard.
- New endpoint **`GET /api/auctions/catalogue/pdf`** (protected by `require_module("auctions")`): pulls contracts with status ∈ [`auction_ready`, `auction`], joins to the correct item collection per `item_type`, streams a `~60KB` PDF.
- Auctions page: added **"Auction Catalogue"** button (`data-testid="auction-catalogue-btn"`) in the header; opens the PDF in the reusable `PdfPreviewDialog` with a Download option.
- i18n keys: `auction_catalogue`, `auction_catalogue_hint` (EN + TET).

### Verification
- Backend curl: `/api/dashboard/summary` → `grace_period_contracts: 19`; `/api/business/metrics` → `grace_period_count: 19`; `/api/reports/v2/overdue` → 169 rows (19 grace + 150 auction_ready); `/api/auctions/catalogue/pdf` → HTTP 200, valid `%PDF-1.4`, 60,211 bytes.
- Playwright: `/business?range=weekly` selects Weekly correctly; Share button present; Auctions page shows Catalogue button; `/contracts?status=grace_period` returns rows.
- No lint issues (JS or Python).

## Iteration 51 — Main Dashboard Info Tooltips (2026-02-22) ✅
- Extended the info-tooltip pattern from Business Dashboard to the main **Dashboard** page (`/app/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.js`).
- Added ⓘ Info icons on **6 KPI cards** (Total Clients, Active Contracts, Overdue Contracts, Total Loan Amount, Total Payments, Profit/Interest) and **5 Status stat cards** (Active, Overdue, Auction Ready, Redeemed, Auction).
- All tooltips localized EN + Tetum via new `info_*` keys in `/app/frontend/src/lib/i18n.js`.
- Critical clarifying tooltip on **Total Loan Amount**: explicitly states this is the ORIGINAL disbursed amount (historical) — not what clients still owe — and points users to the Business Dashboard's *Current Portfolio* for principal remaining after payments.
- Same UX pattern: native `title` attribute + `preventDefault + stopPropagation` so clicking the icon does NOT navigate the parent Link.
- Verified via Playwright: 6 KPI info buttons + 5 Stat info buttons rendered, tooltips populated ("Every client ever registered in the system…").
- No backend / schema / dependency changes.

## Iteration 50 — Business Dashboard Clarity: Labels + Info Tooltips (2026-02-22) ✅
- User asked "what is different loan amount in dashboard business" — realized the KPI wording was ambiguous vs. Contracts/Reports terminology.
- **Renamed KPIs** in `/app/frontend/src/pages/BusinessDashboard.js` for clarity:
  - "Total Loaned Out" → **"Current Portfolio"** (sub: "Principal remaining on all active loans" / "New disbursed <range>: $X")
  - "Interest Earned · <range>" → **"Interest Received · <range>"** (sub: "Realized interest collected via payments")
  - "Projected Interest · <range>" — sub clarified to "Expected at current book · capped by Article 4"
  - "Potential Loss" — unchanged label, tooltip added
- **Info (ⓘ) tooltips** added on all 6 KPI + status cards (Current Portfolio, Interest Received, Projected Interest, Potential Loss, Grace Period, Ready for Auction). Uses native `title` attribute; small `<Info>` icon from lucide-react; `preventDefault + stopPropagation` on click so the parent Link doesn't navigate.
- **i18n keys added** (EN + TET) in `/app/frontend/src/lib/i18n.js`:
  - `business_current_portfolio` / `business_current_portfolio_sub` / `business_new_disbursed`
  - `business_interest_received` / `business_interest_received_sub`
  - `business_projected_sub`
  - `info_current_portfolio`, `info_interest_received`, `info_projected_interest`, `info_potential_loss`, `info_grace_period`, `info_auction_ready`
- **Terminology reference (documented in tooltips)**:
  - **Current Portfolio** = Σ `principal_remaining` across active contracts (snapshot; unaffected by range toggle).
  - **New disbursed** = amount newly disbursed inside the selected Daily/Weekly/30d/YTD window (based on `contract_date`).
  - **Loan Amount** (Contracts/Reports) = original disbursed principal, immutable.
  - **Principal Remaining** = outstanding after partial principal payments — this is what sums into "Current Portfolio".
- Verified via Playwright: `admin@fatinpenhores.tl` → /business → 6 info buttons rendered with correct tooltip text; page renders KPIs correctly ($549,700 portfolio + $364k new-in-range subline).
- No backend / schema / dependency changes.
